In this Project I am learning ExpressJS
ExpressJS helps build servers and APIs
It gives structure so it is more powerful than NodeJS
It give 
        Structure
        Middleware system 
        Utilities
        Extensible
NodeJS = Engine
ExpressJS = Steering wheel + pedals

Express handles
        how requests are routed
        how responses are built 
NodeJs handles
        how JS runs 
        how sockets & events work 
        helps JS to work with filesystem

----------------------------------------------

app.use()
        It registers a middleware
app.set()
        It is basically setting management. Helps to give values for preserved keys(port: 3000)
